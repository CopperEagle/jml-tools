/**
 * XPath query on the AST.
 *
 *
 * This package provides the possibility to apply an XPath query on AST nodes. It wraps the existing classes
 * into XML documents and elements of type `org.w3c.dom`. This allows you to also use them in nearly
 * every system that expect a DOM, e.g., you can print AST as an XML document or xquery.
 *
 *
 * This DOM is immutable.
